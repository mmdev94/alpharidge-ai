Categorical Enums for Classification

All classification decisions use discrete categories (no floats) to enable
deterministic validation via exact matching of canonical strings.

Tweet/Telegram classifications use the original enums (ContentType, Sentiment, etc.).
Article intelligence classifications are defined in alpharidge_ai.models.article_intelligence
and re-exported here for convenience.
