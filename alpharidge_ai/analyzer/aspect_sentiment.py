"""Target-aware per-asset aspect sentiment.

Replaces the former whole-sentence FinBERT majority vote
(``_finbert_asset_sentiments``, now removed). That method scored an entire mention sentence
and could not attribute polarity to a *specific* asset — in a sentence like
"Microsoft shares slid as the broader Nasdaq pulled back" it emitted one label
for the whole sentence, so the subject (MSFT) washed to neutral while a
cleanly-negative throwaway index got the bearish label. Majority-voting hedged
financial prose then amplified neutral.

This module uses **FinABSA** (``amphora/FinABSA``), a financial target-aware
aspect-based sentiment model. The target asset is marked with ``[TGT]`` and the
model classifies the polarity *toward that target*. FinABSA won the FinEntity
bake-off decisively (macro-F1 0.84 vs 0.70 for general DeBERTa-ABSA and 0.68 for
the whole-sentence FinBERT baseline; see ``eval/scripts/bakeoff_aspect.py``).

FinABSA is highly confident per sentence (near one-hot), so per-mention
probabilities carry no useful gradation. Instead the 7-class ``Sentiment`` scale
and magnitude/confidence are derived by **voting across an asset's mention
sentences**: three bearish mentions read very_bearish, one reads bearish, a
bull/bear split reads neutral. This is what stops consistent weak signal from
collapsing to neutral.

Determinism (consensus boundary): pinned model id, eval()/no_grad, greedy
decoding (num_beams=1, do_sample=False), integer vote arithmetic. Identical
output on miner and validator given the same model + device class.

Drop-in contract: ``score_assets(...)`` returns the same list-of-dict shape that
``_build_assets`` already consumes (ticker/direction/magnitude/confidence/
short_term/medium_term/long_term/causal_driver/evidence_spans).

Horizons (short/medium/long) are produced by ``horizon.project_horizons`` via
temporal evidence partitioning (Gate 2): each mention is bucketed by its
time-framing cue and FinABSA-voted per bucket, so the three horizons carry
independent signal (and can disagree in sign) instead of mirroring `direction`.
The rule thresholds there are pending calibration against the horizon gold set.
