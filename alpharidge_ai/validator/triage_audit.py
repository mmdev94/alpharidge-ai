"""Audit-LLM relevance verdict for triage false-negative adjudication.

One cheap tool call over the headline plus a short body slice — orders of
magnitude cheaper than the full ArticleIntelligence reference analysis, which
is what makes it affordable to run on claimed-irrelevant articles.

Deliberately asymmetric. A `True` verdict costs a miner reputation, so it is
returned only when the model is both confident and explicit; anything else —
low confidence, a malformed reply, a transport error — returns None, which the
grader treats as "no event". Mistakes by this model therefore cost us recall
in auditing, never a wrongly punished miner. Combined with the grader keeping
LLM verdicts on the soft path by default, an audit model that is merely decent
cannot meaningfully harm an honest miner.
