"""
Coverage-then-depth article allocator (RFC 2026-06-28).

Pure assignment logic, separated from the validator so it can be tested in
isolation. Given the live miner UIDs and a window-aware tracker, it returns
``(uid, batch_index)`` assignments:

  1. Coverage pass — every live miner that has not been covered this epoch and
     has a free window slot gets exactly one batch (the coverage floor — every live
     miner is scored each epoch).
  2. Depth pass — remaining batches go to miners with window headroom, highest
     window first, round-robin so a single miner can't drain the queue before
     others get a turn.

It is intentionally **fully read-only** on the tracker — coverage is marked by the
caller on *actual dispatch* (not here), and the real per-miner reservation
(``try_acquire``/``release``) stays in the validator's dispatch coroutine, so a
pending-task-cap truncation can neither leak a reserved slot nor mark a miner
covered without sending it work. ``provisional`` mirrors what those acquisitions
will be so we don't assign a miner more than ``floor(window)`` within one tick.
