"""Shared triage schema for miner-side article relevance filtering (schema v3).

Miners triage every dispatched article against the relevance rubric and only
deep-analyze articles they label relevant. Validators grade the triage claims
by audit (see alpharidge_ai/validator/triage_grader.py) instead of producing a
reference analysis for every article.

Rubric (an article is RELEVANT iff either branch holds):
  R1 — concerns >=1 resolvable tradeable asset (equity/fx/crypto/commodity/
       rates/sovereign). Keyword/gazetteer-resolved assets make this branch
       deterministic on both sides.
  R2 — concerns a macro/economic event tied to a named economy or bloc:
       monetary policy, inflation/employment/GDP releases, fiscal/trade/
       sanctions policy, or supply shocks with plausible market transmission.

Wire format: additive keys inside analysis_data (backward compatible — v2
miners simply omit them):
  analysis_data["triage"]        = {"label", "reason_code", "confidence"}
  analysis_data["proof_of_read"] = {"content_hash", "word_count"}

proof_of_read is required for EVERY article in the batch, including ones
labeled irrelevant (which carry no other analysis). Both fields are exactly
recomputable by the validator from its own copy of the article, so a triage
claim is auditable even when no analysis accompanies it.
