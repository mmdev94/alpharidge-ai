                   "in the coming months if economic data continues to improve.",
        "content": """The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points
to a target range of 4.75-5.00%, the second consecutive reduction as policymakers grow more
confident that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference that "the economy is in a good place" and
that the committee will continue to make decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis.

"If the economy evolves broadly as expected, policy will move over time toward a more neutral
stance," Powell said. "But we are not on any preset course."

The decision was unanimous among all 12 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee.

Markets reacted positively, with the S&P 500 rising 1.2% and Bitcoin surging past $98,000.
The U.S. dollar index (DXY) fell 0.8% against a basket of major currencies. Gold prices
jumped 1.5% to $2,780 per ounce.

Treasury yields declined across the curve, with the 10-year yield falling 12 basis points
to 4.18%. The 2-year yield, which is most sensitive to Fed policy expectations, dropped
18 basis points to 4.05%.

Economists at Goldman Sachs now expect the Fed to cut rates by an additional 75 basis points
by mid-2027, bringing the target range to 4.00-4.25%. JPMorgan's forecast is more aggressive,
calling for 100 basis points of cuts over the same period.

The rate cut comes amid mixed economic signals. While the labor market remains resilient with
unemployment at 4.1%, consumer spending has shown signs of cooling. The latest CPI reading
showed inflation at 2.4% year-over-year, down from a peak of 9.1% in 2022.

Bitcoin's rally was attributed to reduced opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets
and increased risk appetite among institutional investors. ETF inflows for the day totaled
$1.8 billion, led by BlackRock's IBIT fund.

Ethereum also gained 3.2% to $4,200, while Solana rose 5.1% to $195. The total crypto
market capitalization exceeded $3.5 trillion for the first time.""",

Wednesday to a range of 4.75%-5.00%, marking the second straight reduction as officials
gained confidence that price pressures are easing.

Chair Jerome Powell told reporters the economy remains on solid footing but acknowledged
that risks to the outlook are "roughly in balance." He declined to pre-commit to the pace
of future rate adjustments.

"We will continue to assess incoming data and the evolving outlook," Powell said.
"The timing and pace of additional rate reductions will depend on the data."

US stocks climbed following the announcement, with the S&P 500 adding 1.2%. The dollar
weakened against major currencies, and Treasury yields retreated sharply.

In the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin jumped above $98,000, while Ethereum gained more
than 3% to trade near $4,200. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $1.8 billion in net inflows.""",

up 120% year-over-year. CEO Jensen Huang called it "the beginning of a new industrial
revolution powered by AI."

Earnings per share came in at $0.81, compared to consensus estimates of $0.72. Gross margins
expanded to 75.1%, up from 72.3% a year ago.

The company guided Q4 revenue of $45 billion, plus or minus 2%, above the $41 billion
consensus. Huang said demand for Blackwell-generation chips is "incredible" and the company
is working to ramp production as fast as possible.

Nvidia shares rose 8% in after-hours trading to $165 per share. The stock is up 280%
year-to-date, making it the third-largest company by market capitalization at $4.1 trillion.

AMD shares fell 3% in sympathy, as investors priced in Nvidia's dominant market position.
TSMC, which manufactures Nvidia's chips, rose 2% on the implied production volume increase.

The attack targeted the exchange's Ethereum bridge contract, exploiting a vulnerability
in the cross-chain transfer mechanism. Stolen assets include approximately $200 million
in ETH, $120 million in USDT, and $80 million in various altcoins.

Bitcoin fell 5% to $93,000 within hours of the news breaking, while Ethereum dropped 7%
to $3,800. The total crypto market capitalization shed approximately $150 billion.

DeFi tokens were hit particularly hard, with Aave (AAVE) falling 12%, Uniswap (UNI) down
10%, and Compound (COMP) declining 9%. Stablecoins briefly depegged, with USDT trading
at $0.997 before recovering.

The exchange has halted all withdrawals and is working with blockchain security firms
to trace the stolen funds. The FBI and SEC have been notified, according to sources
familiar with the matter.

"This is a stark reminder that security must remain the top priority," said a spokesperson
for the exchange. "We are committed to making affected users whole."

Regulatory scrutiny is expected to intensify. SEC Chair has previously warned that
exchanges operating without proper registration face enforcement action. This hack
may accelerate proposed legislation requiring exchanges to maintain proof of reserves.""",

on Wednesday, dramatically escalating the trade war between the world's two largest economies.

The tariff, effective July 1, covers finished chips, chip-making equipment, and raw materials
used in semiconductor manufacturing. The move is expected to raise costs for American
technology companies that rely on Chinese-manufactured components.

Nvidia shares fell 4% on the news, as roughly 20% of its revenue comes from Chinese customers.
AMD dropped 5%, while Intel, which manufactures more chips domestically, gained 2%.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) declined 3.5% on the announcement. Broader markets
also sold off, with the S&P 500 falling 1.8% and the Nasdaq Composite declining 2.5%.

Gold rose 1.2% as investors sought safe-haven assets. Oil prices were unchanged. The dollar
index (DXY) strengthened 0.5% as trade war concerns boosted demand for the reserve currency.

Bitcoin initially fell 2% but recovered to trade flat as crypto traders assessed whether
the tariffs would ultimately be inflationary — historically bullish for BTC.

Chinese officials condemned the action, with the Ministry of Commerce calling it
"a serious violation of WTO rules" and promising "proportional countermeasures."

Economists warn the tariffs could add 0.3 percentage points to US inflation over the next
12 months, potentially complicating the Federal Reserve's rate-cut trajectory.""",
