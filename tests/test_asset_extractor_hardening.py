"""Hardening tests for AssetExtractor — kills the §3.1 false-positive ticker bugs.

These encode the MINER_DATA_QUALITY_REVIEW §3.1 findings as regression tests:
ambiguous dictionary-word / foreign-word / single-letter collisions must NOT
produce tickers unless corroborated by a cashtag, an exact case-sensitive ticker,
a non-ambiguous name, or an in-context financial cue.
